//! Terminal front end for warlock.
//!
//! This binary is the thin, impure shell around the pure parts in
//! `warlock_tui`: it owns the terminal's lifecycle, the working directory it
//! was invoked from, and the event loop, and nothing else. It asks the engine
//! to load the tree for that directory and knows nothing about how one is
//! built; what a frame looks like is [`warlock_tui::draw`]'s business and how
//! the selection moves is [`App`]'s.
//!
//! The one rule this file exists to keep is that the terminal is restored on
//! every way out: a normal quit, an error returned up to `main`, and a panic.
//! Raw mode left switched on after exit means a shell that no longer echoes
//! what the user types, and that is not something they should have to know how
//! to fix.
