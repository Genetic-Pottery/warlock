# warlock

See your codebase the way your AI does. A TUI where documentation is the interface.

> **warlock** *(n.)* one who draws power from a pact with an entity greater than
> themselves. The patron is the model. The pact is the boundary. Invocations are
> agent runs.

## Why this exists

Editors and AI-enabled IDEs bolt AI on the side. The file tree is still the
interface, what they accelerate is how fast you type rather than how well the
model understands, and the model itself is a helper you summon into the margin
of a window built for typing.

Meanwhile most people are shipping AI-written code and sanding it down to look
hand-written. Stripping the em dashes. Not letting the model commit. A whole
industry using AI while performing restraint, which means using it poorly: no
structure, no shared context, no record. The pretending is the waste.

Warlock admits what the game is. The interface is not your filesystem, it is
your project rendered as the AI understands it: a tree of module documents,
coloured by whether that understanding is still true. You can still open files
and read them. That is no longer the main event.

## What it promises

- **Documentation that is actually current.** A stale doc is stale the moment
  the code under it changes, mechanically and immediately. Fresh has to be
  earned by an AI pass that reads the diff and either confirms the doc still
  holds or rewrites it until it does. There is no unjudged middle state,
  because unjudged is stale.
- **A record that survives you.** Every change lands with intent attached in
  the tracker of your choice, and the context lives in the repo. Someone clones
  it and their agent picks up where yours left off. No one's head, no one's
  subscription.
- **Process artifacts as a byproduct.** Most teams LARP process: the ticket
  exists, the doc exists, and both are one-sentence husks. Warlock's artifacts
  are real by construction, because the work runs through them rather than
  around them.
- **Your subscription, your leverage.** Warlock holds no credentials and
  resells no inference. It drives the `claude` CLI you are already paying for,
  and its job is to spend that spend well by feeding it exactly the right slice
  of the project.

This is an AI workflow framework, not an autopilot. The work stays human-gated,
and the guiding principle is narrow on purpose:

> Warlock makes the right thing visible and easy. It never makes the wrong thing
> impossible.

freshness, gating, and where the boundaries are drawn.

## Contributing

Run these three checks before pushing. CI runs exactly the same three commands on
every push and pull request, so if they pass locally they pass there too:

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```
